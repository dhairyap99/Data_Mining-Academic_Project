# Data_Mining-Academic_Project

>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the blood glucose level becomes high, which ultimately leads to other health problems such as heart diseases, kidney disease, etc. According to WHO, the number of people with diabetes has been increased over the years. Machine learning in a medical setting can help enhance medical diagnosis dramatically. This mini project will portray how data related to diabetes can be leveraged to predict if a person has diabetes or not. More specifically, we will focus on how data mining techniques can be utilized to predict diseases such as prediabetes.

List out the functional modules implemented for analysis with brief description of each:

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies by the test subject
- Glucose: Amount of Glucose present in the body
- Blood Pressure: The amount of Blood Pressure of test subject (mmHG)
- Skin Thickness: The thickness of skin of test subject (mm)
- Insulin: The amount of insulin present in the body
- BMI: The body to mass ratio of test subject(kg/m2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: The function which will score the likelihood of Diabetes based on Family History
- Age: The age of test subject (in Years)
-	Outcome (Result): The outcome of the entire attribute taken in consideration
 -	1 representing the subject has Diabetes
 -	0 representing the subject doesn’t have Diabetes

Referenced Data: We will be using an existing data set called the “Pima Indians Diabetes Database” provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Its formatted as diabetes.csv

Product: We have attempted to build an application which can predict if given any symptoms, has diabetes or not
